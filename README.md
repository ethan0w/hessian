hessian
=======

Hessian binary web service protocol. This is a Git mirror of the official Subversion repository where Hessian is actively developped (svn://svn.caucho.com/home/svn/svnroot/resin/trunk/modules/hessian). This mirror is updated automatically on a daily basis. No parallel development is performed here. Feel free to fork this project to implement custom features while tracking upstream changes.


Notice
------
Forked from [ebourg/hessian](https://github.com/ebourg/hessian), I'll try to modify the source to make *JSON* debug available.
